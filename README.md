## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. I am free to use anything I want to practice with it.

## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. Both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to can be found there.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that I need to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This helps train my eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. 

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information I need, such as color palette, breakpoint and fonts.

## Building my project with:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- I use [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) to publish my design. It is easier to use because everytime I make a change with my code it will be automatically updated. 
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), since I use Sass, parcel can watch it easily by running it with parcel instead of running watch. Convert it into css style.
- [HTML5](http://html5doctor.com/)
